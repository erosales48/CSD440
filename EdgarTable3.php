    Starting with the PHP table created in Module 2, write a function that will be used 
    to generate the value to be displayed in each cell. The function will take two random numbers 
    as the parameters and will then return the sum. The function is to be placed in an external file.
-->

<?php
    Function sumNumbers($num1, $num2) {
                return $num1 + $num2;
    }
?>
